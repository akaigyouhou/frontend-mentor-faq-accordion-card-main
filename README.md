## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

I find it's really hard to adjust the layout from mobile to desktop version. I try to use flex, but at last I just wrote down some margin to make it match the design.
